# Just A Few AI Ideas!

## Layout

The `by topic` folder is, as the name suggests, a folder structure grouping similar ideas (or components of them).

`Notes`contains some more high-level material and more general thoughts about how the developments in different components of evolving AI architectures can fit together.

`Source-repos` is mostly for organizational use and preserves the first copies of the raw ideas that were sometimes used to generate the hopefully more organized documents here (for notes on that, see below).

## Purpose Statement

During 2024, I made the decision that instead of jotting down the occasional idea as a Google Doc, I would begin trying to open source as much of my thinking and first entry notes as possible - essentially creating something like a public notepad or a digital garden comprised of Github repositories. 

Although it's perhaps an unconventional use of Github, you could say that I've fallen in love with documenting this way. Each repository houses an idea or the beginning of a project.  Often these repositories are interconnected - they're components of one larger project. Or they are iterations of an idea that evolves over time.

2024 was, for me, the year of drinking from the firehose of AI. And in 2025, I'm beginning to feel like I have a more organized and cohesive approach to what excites me about the technology.  

The purpose of this repository is to firstly gather in some of the ideas that I've been working on to date and organize them into their logical categories.

By doing so, going forward, I hope that this can provide a sort of index for a different ideas at their first entry stage. They might later branch out into their own repositories if they are more developed and contain code. Or this might be their ultimate destination. 

The folder will be a basic hierarchy with similar ideas organized into folders.  I'll use Github submodules to gather the source material for ideas being summarized here where those are discrete repositories. But going forward, the process will be reversed. Ideas will begin here and later branch out if applicable.  

I love chatting with AI vendors, those also passionate about exploring the many interesting use cases that are quickly becoming not only feasible, but highly practical. So if you're working on something similar or would like to collaborate, don't be shy about reaching out!
